## Documentation of Process
The project followed a systematic approach starting from planning, team overview, reflection on revisions, and usability evaluations. The team made several changes based on the feedback received from the usability evaluations, the instructor, and the peer evaluation. The changes include reorganization of UI elements, resizing of UI elements, change in media use, removal and addition of UI elements, change in title and field names, and edits to copy among others.

## Usability Testing
Usability testing was conducted with a set of tasks designed to identify areas of improvement. The testing was conducted as a think-aloud session where participants were asked to vocalize their thoughts, actions, and feelings as they performed their tasks. The data collected from these sessions were used to make further improvements to the website.

## Evaluation Findings
The evaluation findings helped the team to understand the user experience better and make necessary changes to improve the website. The team was able to gather insightful inputs that helped improve the website.

## Future Work
The team will continue to make improvements based on the feedback received and aim to provide a better user experience. The goal is to make AggieBazaar a go-to platform for the Aggie community to exchange pre-owned items.
